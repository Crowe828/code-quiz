# Code Quiz

This is application is intended to ask a user a series of questions focused on assessing their coding capabilities. There is a timer that starts at 75 seconds, and goes down until the user finishes the quiz or the timer reaches zero. If they get a question wrong, they will be deducted five seconds. After the quiz has finished they will be prompted to enter their initials and save their final score. This application is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
